 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  
My grandmother was a simple woman.  
Born on a farm, she believed it was 
man's divine right to benefit from 
the bounty of nature God put before 
us.  If we were to live in the 
topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson 
imagines, just think of what it 
would mean.  Maybe I would have to 
negotiate with the silk worm for 
the elastic in my britches.  
Talking bee.  How do we know this 
isnâ€™t some sort of holographic 
motion picture capture Hollywood 
wizardry?
