Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation:

-Overview:
For this assignment, we were to implement a binary search tree that separates values from the tree, and sort the values, that may be repeated, from the key.

-Features:
Insert (Set):
Add or update a key-value pair in the BST.

Find:
Search for a key and its associated value.

Delete:
Remove a key and its associated value.

Print (In-Order Traversal):
Display the BST contents in sorted order based on keys.

Find Minimum and Maximum:
Find the smallest or largest key in the tree.

Save to File:
Save the contents to a file in sorted order.

Memory:
The destructor makes sure all dynamically allocated nodes are deleted.

-Files:
bst.h:
Header file that defines the Node and BST classes.

bst.cpp:
Implementation file that provides the methods for the Node and BST classes.

main.cpp:
Main program for interacting with the BST by using a menu.

-How to run:
Compile with g++ -o bst main.cpp bst.cpp

Run with ./bst_progam
